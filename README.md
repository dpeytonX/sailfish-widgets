<h2>Jolla Store Instructions: </h2>
The following are instructions to using SailfishWidgets with your own project. This project will <strong>PASS</strong> Jolla QA as long as you follow the following instructions. If you find a more clever way to do this, by all means share :-). Replace <em>your-project</em> with the name of your application (without the harbour-)
<ol>
  <li> First, download the source code and put the <code>SailfishWidgets</code> folder within the <code>harbour/<em>your-project</em></code> directory</li>
  <li> Then, edit the first line of qmldir. This is easiest accomplished with the following BASH command. 
<pre>find . -name "qmldir" -exec sed -i "s/module SailfishWidgets/module harbour.<em>yourAppName</em>.SailfishWidgets/" \{} \;</pre>.
If you are on Windows, manually edit each qmldir that you use to <code>module harbour.<em>your-project</em>.SailfishWidgets.</em>CurrentPackage</em></code>.</li>
  <li> For using with QtCreator add the following<pre>
OTHERFILES += harbour/<em>your-app</em>/SailfishWidgets/*
QML_IMPORT_PATH = .
<em>your-app</em>.files = harbour
<em>your-app</em>.path = /usr/share/$${TARGET}
</pre></li>
   <li> In any QML file you want to edit add the following import statement: <code>import harbour.<em>your-app</em>.SailfishWidgets.<em>SomePackage</em> <em>current-version</em></code></li>
</ol>
